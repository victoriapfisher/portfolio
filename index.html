      <h1>Victoria Fisher, MPH</h1>
      <p>I am a Research Associate and Project Manager for the Prioritizing Roots of Oppression in Epidemiologic Systems Science (PROWESS) Group at Michigan State University, College of Human Medicine under PI <a href="https://chmfamilymedicine.msu.edu/people/nadia-abuelezam">Nadia Abuelezam, ScD</a>. I have an MPH from <a href="https://landscapes.isr.umich.edu/2022/11/03/collaborator-spotlight-victoria-fisher/">the University of Michigan</a> with a focus on aging-related disease and epigenetics.</p>
      <p>My research seeks to understand upstream mechanisms of health disparities and social determinants of health, with particular interests in employing epidemiologic systems science approaches and political economics frameworks.</p>
      <p>Prior to epidemiology, I worked in strategic communications for six years, with specific experience in architecture and design, higher education, and science communications. My creative portfolio can be found <a href="https://www.victoriaparis.work">here</a>.</p>

      <h2>Current Work</h2>
      <p>Recently, I have been thinking about the ways "place" can be conceptualized using intersectionality theory, if we assume the same forces that position people and identities are also impacting who shapes place, where, and how. I'm working on the creation of a geometric growth index of changes in availability of SDoH amenities in the built environment (schools, grocery stores, hospitals, etc.) and the relationship to COVID-19 mortality.</p>

      <h2>Outside of Work</h2>
      <p>I live in Cambridge, MA with my partner and our Bonsai tree. I enjoy running, hiking in Vermont and New Hampshire, reading, waiting for my models to run, and leaving knitting projects half-finished.</p>
