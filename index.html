      <h1>Victoria Fisher, MPH</h1>
      <p>I am a Research Associate and Project Manager for the Prioritizing Roots of Oppression in Epidemiologic Systems Science (PROWESS) Group at Michigan State University, College of Human Medicine under PI <a href="https://chmfamilymedicine.msu.edu/people/nadia-abuelezam">Nadia Abuelezam, ScD</a>. I have an MPH from <a href="https://landscapes.isr.umich.edu/2022/11/03/collaborator-spotlight-victoria-fisher/">the University of Michigan</a> with a focus on aging-related disease and epigenetics.</p>
      <p>My research seeks to understand upstream mechanisms of health disparities and social determinants of health, with particular interests investigating how the quantitative methods we use match the theories and frameworks that guide our research.</p>
      <p>Prior to epidemiology, I worked in strategic communications for six years, with specific experience in architecture and design, higher education, and science communications. My creative portfolio can be found <a href="https://www.victoriaparis.work">here</a>.</p>

      <h2>Current Work</h2>
      <p>Recently, I have been thinking about model specifications, structural determinants of health, and data-generating processes.</p>

      <h2>Outside of Work</h2>
      <p>I live in Cambridge, MA with my partner and our Bonsai tree. I enjoy running, climbing, escaping to Vermont and New Hampshire, reading, waiting for my models to run, and leaving knitting projects half-finished.</p>
