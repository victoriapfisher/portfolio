Hi there, I'm Victoria!  

I am a research associate and project manager for the Prioritizing Roots of Oppression in Epidemiologic Systems Science (PROWESS) Group at Michigan State University, College of Human Medicine under PI Nadia Abuelezam, ScD. I have an MPH from the University of Michigan with a focus on ageing-related disease and genetics. 

Prior to epidemiology, I worked in strategic communications for six years, and have specific experience in achitecture and design, higher academic, and science communications. My creative portfolio can be found [here](https://www.victoriaparis.work). (works best in Chrome)

I live in Cambridge, MA, with my boyfriend. I enjoy running, hiking in Vermont and New Hampshire, reading, and leaving knitting projects half-finished.
