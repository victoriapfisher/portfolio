# Victoria Paris Fisher, MPH

I am a Research Associate and Project Manager for the Prioritizing Roots of Oppression in Epidemiologic Systems Science (PROWESS) Group at [Michigan State University](https://humanmedicine.msu.edu/), College of Human Medicine under PI [Nadia Abuelezam, ScD](https://www.nadiascience.com/). I have an MPH from the [University of Michigan](https://sph.umich.edu/) with a focus on aging-related disease and genetics.

My research seeks to understand upstream mechanisms of health disparities and social determinants of health, with particular interests in employing epidemiologic systems science approaches and political economics frameworks.

Prior to epidemiology, I worked in strategic communications for six years, with specific experience in architecture and design, higher education, and science communications. My creative portfolio can be found [here](https://www.victoriaparis.work).

## Current Work

As part of the PROWESS Group, I contribute to research examining the roots of health disparities through systems science approaches. Currently, I am working on the creation of a geometric growth index of changes in availability of SDoH amenities in the built environment (schools, grocery stores, hospitals, etc.) from 2014 - 2019, and the relationship to COVID-19 mortality.
