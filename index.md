# Victoria Paris Fisher, MPH

I am a Research Associate and Project Manager for the Prioritizing Roots of Oppression in Epidemiologic Systems Science (PROWESS) Group at [Michigan State University](https://humanmedicine.msu.edu/), College of Human Medicine under PI [Nadia Abuelezam, ScD](https://www.nadiascience.com/). I have an MPH from the [University of Michigan](https://sph.umich.edu/) with a focus on aging-related disease and genetics.

My research focuses on understanding health disparities and social determinants of health, with particular interests in epidemiologic systems science, aging-related disease, and genetics.

Prior to epidemiology, I worked in strategic communications for six years, with specific experience in architecture and design, higher education, and science communications. My creative portfolio can be found [here](https://www.victoriaparis.work).

## Current Work

As part of the PROWESS Group, I contribute to research examining the roots of health disparities through systems science approaches.

## Background

My interdisciplinary background spans both public health research and strategic communications, providing a unique perspective on translating complex health research for diverse audiences.
